## Features

- **User Feedback Submission**: Users can submit their feedback through a simple and intuitive form.
- **Feedback Display**: All submitted feedback will be displayed on the main page, giving users a clear view of their entries.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, offering utility-first CSS to keep the design simple yet effective.
- **CSS Planning**: Tailwind CSS is being used with CSS planning to ensure the app remains flexible and easy to update.
